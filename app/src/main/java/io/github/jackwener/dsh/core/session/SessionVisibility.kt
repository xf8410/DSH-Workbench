/**
 * Which sessions belong to the user (#43). The engine reports every dsh session it runs, also the
 * ones plugins start for themselves (a heartbeat, a QQ bot: cwd = their own data dir). dsh's session
 * header has no marker a plugin could set for that (`origin` only ever says "subagent"), so the rule
 * is ownership: the app writes a `sessions` row only for what it starts itself — a prompt from the
 * composer or an automation (SessionStore.prompt) and the subagents of those (`subagent.started`).
 * A session without a row is a plugin's background session and is never shown or announced.
 *
 * One rule for the session list, the notifications and the pages a tap can open, so a session never
 * shows up in one of them (e.g. as 「新会话」 after a notification tap) while being absent from the list.
